- Real-time calculations and results display

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/firefish-calculator.git
    cd firefish-calculator
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    There are no specific dependencies for this project apart from Python 3.

### Running the Server

To run the project locally, you can use a simple Python HTTP server. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd firefish-calculator
    ```

2. **Run the Python HTTP server:**

    For Python 3.x:

    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

    The default port is `8000`. If you need to use a different port, you can specify it like this:

    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8080
    ```

3. **Open your browser and navigate to:**

    ```
    http://localhost:8000
    ```

    Replace `8000` with your specified port if you used a different one.

### Usage

2. **Enter the start date, loan duration, currency, loan amount, and interest rate.**
3. **View the results to see if using BTC as collateral was worth it for the specified period.**
